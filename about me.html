          <div class="about-me">
            <p>Second Year Undergraduate student in Bachelor of Information Technology that always passionate to learn more about technology field
              <br> <br>

              I am a person that always try to explore deeper about something new that I learned in my life. From the technology perspective, it always important to keep on updated about new & improvised frameworks because technology always keep
              evolving as we speak today. Within the period of my studies currently, I discovered that web development matters attracts my interest to explore more about it. In my web development subject, it only covers on the basic languages such as
              HTML, CSS, JS, PHP in which I did not get the chance to learn about its available frameworks. There are many frameworks that available out there such as Bootstrap, Node.js, Vue.js, Laravel, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and more to mention
              about. Nevertheless, it does not stop me from letting my curiosity to be depleted in the learning process. I made my self initiative to learn some of the frameworks which is currently on Bootstrap that helps me a lot in designing my
              website more better. How do I start to learn about the frameworks that I have mentioned above i.e Bootstrap, Node.js, Vue.js, Laravel, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and etc? By subscribing an online course entitled 'The Complete 2021 Web
              Development Bootcamp' on Udemy that taught all the modules of becoming a Frontend & Backend Web Developer
              <br> <br>

              As opportunities open the path for more possibilities, I am welcoming more opportunities for me to learn more about the field of technology that I currently exploring into. It may not be about web development only as I understand that
              being an IT person it is important for me to be agile and aware about other fields of technology as well
